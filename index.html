        <div class="subheading mb-5">Actor-Content Creator-Entertainer</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a potential upcoming actor & digital/ media arts professional with experience in Modeling, Acting, and Content creation, I was excited to see your open position. My Confidence, Determination, and Ability to stand out have served me well in previously similar roles and make me uniquely qualified for this particular role. For the past 12 years, I have attended a top-performing arts school based in Los Angeles. With various acting classes and performing arts schools, I've mastered how to act, model, dance, and sing. I've been doing musical theater for twelve years and can perform on stage or screen. I have done runway and commercial modeling for small businesses. With the support of these organizations, I've been exposed to a wide range of roles and opportunities, including music videos, spec advertising, short films, and background acting/dancing. 

<br><br>

        As far as representation I was signed to an agency when I was 6 years of age. My mom was like my management and controlled all the business and financial side of things. Now that I am 18 I took it upon myself to get signed by a new agency. I needed a representation that would showcase me as a young adult actor. As I move forward in  my career I want to be taken seriously and for my craft as an actor to be respected. I came across an agency that is well-known and respected and did my research. I applied for the Theatrical, Print, Commercial and Modeling Department. I was welcomed shortly after where I can tell people my representation is Todd Agency. I am involved in behind the camera as well as directing, producing, scriptwriting and cinematography. I have been a part of multiple film festivals, film ceremonies and even produced my own student short film project. I also got the opportunity to be a part of the Promise Film Internship at The Academy Of Motion Pictures. I was paid to learn about filmmaking and the process of becoming an independent filmmaker. I was a production assistant for multiple film productions as well. 

<br><br>

        Outside of Acting, Dancing, and Modeling gigs, I have previously advertised for multiple TikTok/Hair/Make-Up brands as a social media influencer. Although I am still building my Instagram audience, I maintain an average of 30k followers on TikTok. I get paid to promote wigs and in the process of that, I was able to become an entrepreneur for my business. I created a wig resell page called Moni’s Resells. I re-sell my wigs I received to other woman and made a page out of it. Not only do I use my account and fan base as a comedy go-to where young adults can laugh and relate, but I also use it to help build and expose brands across the U.S.
